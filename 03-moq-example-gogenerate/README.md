# GoGenerated Example

This is exactly the same code as 02 with one exception, we have added a mock.go file.

This file has a single purpose, to hold our GoGenerate functions which are used to generate and re-generate our mocked interfaces when they change.

To run, simply open the file in your IDE and hit the play button...nice!

Another option is to keep these GoGenerate comments with the interfaces, having them in one file means you can re-generate everything in one go, as well as running them individually.
